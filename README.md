# Projects for Security and Privacy 2025

## Assignment #1: Performance Benchmarking of Cryptographic Mechanisms, April 2025

The purpose of this project is to measure the time AES, RSA and SHA-256 take to process files of different sizes, using a python implementation for the encryption/decryption and hash mechanisms. 

### Content of this repository:
- Random file generator (Python);
- File folders for each algorithm, with different files with different sizes;
- Encryption/Decryption functions, functions that measure the time it takes to process files and functions to present the results for AES and RSA (Python);
- Hash function, functions that measure the time it takes to process files and functions to present the results for SHA-256 (Python);
- Report in all formats (Jupyter Notebook, HTML, PDF);
- Reading Material to guide the project (PDF);
